Docker compose
==============

[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) help you build all components into single "docker application". First of all check documentation for this tool. You will find out that docker compose simply describes architecture of your deployed app and dependencies between containers. A that's docker compose!

### Your task is:

1. Prepare docker stack of your dockerized apps from previous exercise
2. Build and run your application by using `docker-compose`
3. Add reverse proxy into your application stack (we recommend this: [jwilder/nginx-proxy](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy))

### Bonus task
Do you use Continuous Integration server? Why don't you setup your infrastructure to be able build your images and push them into docker registry?
